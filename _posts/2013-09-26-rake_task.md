<p class="lead">Runs a Rake task on a regular basis. The output of the run can be seen on the app detail page</p>

## Requirements

- Cloud 66  Agent
- Rake
- Bundle
- Linux

## Type
This is a scheduled app that runs on regular intervals defined by you. Learn more about [setting up schedules](settingup_schedules).

## Setup
The following fields can be configured for this app

<table class='table table-bordered table-striped'>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Field</th>
			<th>Description</th>
			<th>Presence</th>
			<th>Comments</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>Task</td>
			<td>Rake task name</td>
			<td><span class='label label-important'>Required</span></td>
			<td>Example: <kbd>db:cleanup</kbd></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Rails app location</td>
			<td>Directory where your Rails app lives.</td>
			<td><span class='label label-important'>Required</span></td>
			<td>This is where you would normally run the Rake task from</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Parameters</td>
			<td>Rake task parameters</td>
			<td><span class='label'>Optional</span></td>
			<td>Any parameters that you would want to pass into Rake. Example: <kbd>RAILS_ENV=production</kbd></td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

## Remarks
1. Rake tasks are executed using <kbd>bundle exec</kbd>.
2. Run results (success, failure and any output) can be seen in real-time on the app details page.
3. Make sure the rake task is running on the right environment. Environment variables are not available to rake tasks and they have to be explicitly assigned in the command parameters.

## Suggestions
The best way to test your rake tasks before scheduling them is to run them directly on the server manually until you are sure they are all good to go.
