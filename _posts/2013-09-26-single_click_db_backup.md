<p class="lead">Ensure your databases are backed up regularly with a single-click and store them locally or in a cloud storage</p>

## Simple Regular DB Backups
If you have a stack with a database, you can back it up with a single click in the Protips area.

After that, you only need to tell Cloud 66 how often you would like to backup your database.

Backups are automatically performed on stack's database at the scheduled times.

## Backup Reports
You can see the backup status by clicking on the backup icon.

Backup details job tells you more information about the backup job, when it runs and how long it took for it to run.

## Advanced Settings
You can modify backup job settings from the backup job details page. Here you can choose the localtion for your backup files (local or offsite to a cloud storage for example), change the backup schedule or choose which one of your servers runs the backup job.

These settings are different depending on the database you use. Look for more information about [job scheduling](/help/settingup_schedules) and [database backups](/help/mysql_backup).
