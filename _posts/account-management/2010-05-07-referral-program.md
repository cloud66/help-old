When you share Cloud 66 with your friends, they get $10 in credit with us (on top of their 2 week trial) and we'll send you a $20 Amazon credit when they spend $20.

## How it works
1. Tell your friend about Cloud 66.
2. Your friend signs up, gets $10 in credit and deploys their stack.
3. We send you the credit once they've spent $20.

## Your referral code
You have your own unique referral URL that you can find under your [Account page](https://app.cloud66.com/accounts/refer). Use the referral URL to share Cloud 66 with your friends on Facebook, Twitter or just by good old fashioned email.
