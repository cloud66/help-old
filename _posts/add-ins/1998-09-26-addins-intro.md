Add-ins allow you to add various internal and external features to your stack. These include [database backups](/add-ins/backups.html), [SSL certificates](/add-ins/ssl.html) and server components such as [Redis](/add-ins/redis.html) and [Elasticsearch](/add-ins/elasticsearch.html).

To get started, simply click on the _+_ button on the add-ins menu:

A <font color="green">green</font> add-in indicates that there aren't any known issues with that specific add-in, whereas a <font color="red">red</font> add-in indicates an error.
