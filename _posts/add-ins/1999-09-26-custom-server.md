Adding a custom server to your stack allows you to manage your own services while still benefiting from the Cloud 66 ecosystem.

A custom server will have the following Cloud 66 features enabled:

- [Monitoring](/stack-features/server-monitoring.html)
- [Security](/stack-features/stack-security.html)
- Use of [Cloud 66 add-ins](/add-ins/addins-intro.html)
- [Log rotation](/stack-features/logging.html)
- [SSH to your server via toolbelt](/cloud-66-toolbelt/ssh.html)

To add a custom server, begin by accessing the add-ins menu:

You will then be able to choose the size of your new server and how many you'd like to add:

Once your server is added, you'll be able to see and manage it as part of your stack:
