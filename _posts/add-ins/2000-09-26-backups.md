<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
You can easily schedule database backups with an add-in:

![Tja](http://cdn.cloud66.com/images/help/addin_backup.png)

You can subsequently specify if you would like managed or unmanaged backups, how often you would like to backup your database, whether or not you would like to Gzip compress your backups, and which tables you want to exclude from your backup.

<div class="notice">
    <h3>Important</h3>
    <p>Compressing your backups will take up less space than not, but will require additional processing during the compression.</p>
    <p>In order for backups to work, you are required to have twice as much space on your server as your backup consumes.</p>
    <p>If enabled, the gzip compression level used by default is 6 (this is not currently editable). See more information about this in the excellent <a href='https://github.com/meskyanichi/backup/wiki/Compressors' target='_blank'>backup gem documentation.</a></p>
</div>

The <i>exclude tables</i> option only applies to MySQL and PostgreSQL databases. Also worth noting is that you have the option to move the backup service to your [database replica](/stack-features/database-replication.html) if available, to relieve pressure from your production database.

Once you have added your backup, it is available on your stack page:

<h2 id="managed">Managed backups</h2>
Having managed backups carries several benefits:

- You can download database backups through the web UI and [API](/api/basics/basics.html)
- [Backup verifiers](/stack-features/backup-verifiers.html) ensure that your backups actually contain what you expect
- Use [database replication](/stack-features/database-replication.html) to scale your databases
- You can easily restore database backups
- Stored in Cloud 66 storage

<h2 id="unmanaged">Unmanaged backups</h2>

Unmanaged backups are stored on your local server and are available under `/var/cloud66/backups`.
