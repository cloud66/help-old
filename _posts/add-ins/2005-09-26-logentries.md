Once your stack is deployed, you can easily use Logentries for centralized log files:
![Logentries example](http://cdn.cloud66.com/images/help/addin_logentries.png)

We'll ask you for your Logentries account key - if you don't have one, you can signup to a Logentries account:
![Logentries add](http://cdn.cloud66.com/images/help/addin_example_logentries.png)

You can find your Logentries account ID in your account page.
