## Note
* Rake tasks are executed using <kbd>bundle exec</kbd>.
* Run results (success, failure and any output) can be seen in real-time on the detail page.
* Make sure that the rake task is running on the right environment. Environment variables are not available to rake tasks and they have to be explicitly assigned in the command parameters.
