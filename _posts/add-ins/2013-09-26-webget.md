<p class="lead">Runs an HTTP GET against a URL on regular basis. It also supports Basic Authentication</p>

## Requirements
- Cloud 66  Agent
- Linux, Unix, FreeBSD or OS X


## Type
This is a scheduled app that runs on regular intervals defined by you. Learn more about [setting up schedules](settingup_schedules).

## Setup
The following fields can be configured for this app

<table class='table table-bordered table-striped'>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Field</th>
			<th>Description</th>
			<th>Presence</th>
			<th>Comments</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>URL</td>
			<td>URL target of HTTP GET</td>
			<td><span class='label label-important'>Required</span></td>
			<td>The full URL Example: <kbd>http://www.google.com/search</kbd></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Username</td>
			<td>Basic Authentication username</td>
			<td><span class='label'>Optional</span></td>
			<td></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Password</td>
			<td>Basic Authentication password</td>
			<td><span class='label'>Optional</span></td>
			<td></td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

## Remarks
1. Results of the run (failure or success) will be visiable in real-time on the apps details page.
2. Contents of the Get (the web page behind the URL for example) is not retrieved or stored by this app.
3. The app treats any HTTP status except 200 as a failure.
4. A long running HTTP GET of more than 60 seconds will be terminated.

## Suggestions
- One usecase for this app could be triggering a job on any of the web servers behind a load balancer on a schedule.
