<p class="lead">Cloud 66 API is a way for developers to use Cloud 66 functionality from their own apps and scripts</p>

## Getting Started
Cloud 66 API uses [OAuth 2.0](http://oauth.net/2/). To use it you need an OAuth 2.0 compatible client.

The API endpoint is 

<code>https://www.cloud66.com/api/2</code>

## Enabling the Developer Mode
Before you can start developing your API client for Cloud 66, you need to enable developers mode on your account.

Login to your Cloud 66 account at [cloud66.com](http://www.cloud66.com) and enable your account as a Developer account under Account/Apps.

![developer mode](http://cdn.cloud66.com.s3.amazonaws.com/images/help/enable_developer_mode.png)

Once your account is a developer one, you will see a Developers link on the left menu.

## Registering your client
Now you can register your API client. Click on New Application button and enter the name of your client and the OAuth 2.0 callback URL.

![register app](http://cdn.cloud66.com.s3.amazonaws.com/images/help/add_new_application.png)

<p>If you don't have a publicly available callback URL yet, you can use <kbd>urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob</kbd> as the callback URL.</p>

![application form](http://cdn.cloud66.com.s3.amazonaws.com/images/help/new_app_form.png)

You will see the Application Id and Secret after registeration which you can with your OAuth 2.0 client.

## OAuth Flow
Cloud 66 uses OAuth 2 to authenticate and grant access to stacks and redeployments.
To get your app authorized, you'd need to follow the OAuth flow in the app. Here is how it works:

#### 1. Redirect users to request Cloud 66 access
<code>GET https://www.cloud66.com/oauth/authorize</code>

<table class='table table-bordered table-striped'>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Parameter</th>
			<th>Description</th>
			<th>Presence</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>client_id</td>
			<td>The client ID you received from Cloud 66 when you registered.</td>
			<td><span class='label label-important'>Required</span></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>redirect_uri</td>
			<td>URL in your app where users will be sent after authorization. See details below about redirect urls.</td>
			<td><span class='label label-important'>Required</span></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>scope</td>
			<td>Comma separated list of scopes.</td>
			<td><span class='label'>Optional</span></td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

#### 2. Cloud 66 redirects back to your site
If the user accepts your request, Cloud 66 redirects back to your site with a temporary code in a code parameter as well as the state you provided in the previous step in a state parameter. If the states don’t match, the request has been created by a third party and the process should be aborted.

Exchange this for an access token:

<code>POST https://www.cloud66.com/oauth/token</code>

<table class='table table-bordered table-striped'>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Parameter</th>
			<th>Description</th>
			<th>Presence</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>client_id</td>
			<td>The client ID you received from Cloud 66 when you registered.</td>
			<td><span class='label label-important'>Required</span></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>redirect_uri</td>
			<td>URL in your app where users will be sent after authorization. See details below about redirect urls.</td>
			<td><span class='label'>Optional</span></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>client_secret</td>
			<td>The client secret you received from Cloud 66 when you registered.</td>
			<td><span class='label label-important'>Required</span></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>code</td>
			<td>The code you received as a response to Step 1.</td>
			<td><span class='label label-important'>Required</span></td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

##### Response
By default, the response will take the following form:

`access_token=e72e16c7e42f292c6912e7710c838347ae178b4a&amp;token_type=bearer`

<code>Accept: application/json
{"access\_token":"e72e16c7e42f292c6912e7710c838347ae178b4a","token\_type":"bearer"}</code>

#### 3. Use the access token to access the API
The access token allows you to make requests to the API on a behalf of a user.

<code>GET https://www.cloud66.com/api/2/a/stack.json?access_token=e72e...b4a</code>

### Redirect URLs
The redirect_uri parameter is optional. If left out, Cloud 66 will redirect users to the callback URL configured in the OAuth Application settings. If provided, the redirect URL must match the callback URL’s host.

<code>CALLBACK: http://example.com</code>
	
<code>GOOD: https://example.com
GOOD: http://example.com/bar
BAD:  http://example.com:8080
BAD:  http://oauth.example.com:8080
BAD:  http://example.org</code>

### Scopes

Scopes let you specify exactly what type of access you need. Scopes limit access for OAuth tokens. They do not grant any additional permission beyond that which the user already has.

For the web flow, requested scopes be displayed to the user on the authorize form.

#### (no scope)
public read-only access (list of stacks and some information about them).

#### public
public read-only access (list of stacks and some information about them).

#### redeploy
Redeploy a stack.

#### jobs
View scheduled jobs

#### users
Manage user mobile devices using the API

#### admin
Set and manage settings for servers

<strong>NOTE</strong>
Your application can request the scopes in the initial redirection. You can specify multiple scopes by separating them by a space.

<code>https://www.cloud66.com/oauth/authorize?client_id=...&amp;scope=public+redeploy</code>

### Third-party Libraries
If you are writing a client for Cloud 66 in Ruby (or any Ruby backed framework like Rails) the best option is to use a gem like [oauth2](https://github.com/intridea/oauth2).
