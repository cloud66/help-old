<p class="lead">API Examples</p>

## Introduction
We use OAuth 2 for our API authentication and access control. Implementing OAuth 2 is easier than OAuth 1 and there are many libraries in different languages that make it even easier to write an OAuth 2 client. Here are some examples for a Cloud 66 API client.

## Ruby

### Gem used
* [oauth2](https://github.com/intridea/oauth2)

This example shows how to get the first token using the Application (Client) ID and Secret. This is using **urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob** for commandline tools.

Once you have the code, you can apply for a token. Tokens issued by the API server do not expire and are valid until the user revokes their access. You can see how to store and retrieve the token for future use in this example.
