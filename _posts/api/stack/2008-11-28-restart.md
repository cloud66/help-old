Restarts the stack.

Restarting the stack currently means:
* Environment variables are synced back to all servers.
* Nginx and Application Servers (unicorn, passenger,...) are restarted.

This is not a synchronous operation. The request will be queued and might succeed or fail later.

### Request

* None

### Response

A queued request will look like this:

<code class="inline-code">{
	"ok" : true,
	"message" : "Restart is queued"
}</code>

### Error

* 400 - No Stack UID specified
* 404 - Stack not found
* 400 - No deploy rights - Caller doesn't have Redeploy rights over the stack
