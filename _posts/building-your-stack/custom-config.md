<h2 id="custom">What is CustomConfig?</h2>

CustomConfig allows you to edit and modify component configuration templates used by Cloud 66 to configure your servers. This is currently available for Nginx, HAProxy and database configurations, and more configuration templates are forthcoming.

CustomConfig uses the [Liquid templating language](http://www.liquidmarkup.org/) developed by [Shopify](http://www.shopify.com/) and used by many websites. There are many good resources on the web on how to use the Liquid syntax.

<h2 id="preview">Preview a template</h2>
To use Nginx as an example, go to your Web Servers group detail page and click _Nginx CustomConfig_ in the right sidebar. This page will show you the template used to build the Nginx configuration when Nginx is deployed during your stack built or reconfigured. Once you're done with editing your template, you can preview the results by clicking on the <i>Preview</i> button.

See our documentation for more details about CustomConfig for [Nginx](/web-server/nginx), [HAProxy](/web-server/haproxy) and [databases](/database-management/database-management).

<div class="notice">
    <h3>Important</h3>
    <p>Preview is generated with dummy data about your server (like the number of cores or the path for different binaries). Refer to our documentation to learn about how the size of your instance affects the number of <a href="/web-server/nginx">Nginx workers on your server.</a></p>
</div>

<h2 id="submit">Submit template changes</h2>

When you are happy with the results, enter a commit message and press the <i>Commit to Server</i> button. This will compile the configuration with real data and push it to all applicable servers in your stack. It also performs any post commit steps necessary like reloading Nginx with the new configuration file, putting your changes into effect.

This process takes place in the background and might take some time to complete depending on the number of servers in a stack and the nature of the configuration.You can subsequently see the history of your configuration changes with simple colored diff views alongside dates and comments.

<h2 id="update">About updating configuration files and patches</h2>

Every so often, Cloud 66 needs to update the base configuration files used for your application to run. When a patch is released, having customized configurations introduces complexities due to the differences in settings. Some of these files are part of CustomConfig, which allows users to customize their configuration files.

When a patch is released, having customized configurations introduces complexities due to the differences in settings. If you don't have customized content, the patch will be automatically applied.

<div class="notice">
    <h3>Note</h3>
    <p>Failure to apply configuration updates may lead to unexpected behaviour.</p>
</div>

If you do have changes you will need to download a patch file, which is an archive containing the current template and the patch file. Extract the contents of the archive and run the following command:

{% highlight bash %}
patch <current_template> -i <patch_file> -R -o <merged_template>
{% endhighlight %}

This will result in a merged_template file being created - please ensure that there are no merge errors at this point. Unfortunately we cannot deal with every single use case generically, so it is your responsibility to ensure that the new file conforms with your requirements.

In the absence of merge errors, copy and paste the contents of the merged_template into your CustomConfig form and commit it.
