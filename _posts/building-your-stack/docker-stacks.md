<h2 id="docker">Introduction to Docker</h2>
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is an open-source project that helps developers publish applications inside containers. There are many benefits to using Docker: 

- **Separation of Dev and Ops**: It has previously been difficult to seperate the responsibility between Dev and Ops. With Docker deployments, Devs simply put their code into a container (which they can verify works as expected), and Ops take responsibility for rolling it out and managing it.

- **Micro-services** (multi-tenancy): Instead of running monolithic applications, we are now seeing an increasing amount of micro-services, whereby complex applications are composed of smaller components which speak with each other. Being able to run multiple micro-services on the same server (multi-tenancy) is easy with Docker.

- **Portability**: Docker containers make it a lot easier to achieve immutable infrastructure, as the main logic of your application isn't tied to a specific server.

- **Static containers**: You can now achieve consistency across environments - that is, you can replicate your production environment locally if needed.

- **Deploy anything!**: As long as you can put it in a container, you can deploy it to any cloud with Cloud 66. You will still benefit from the many features previously only available to Ruby stacks, as well as numerous features built specifically for Docker deployments.

<h2 id="intro">Cloud 66 Docker support</h2>
Cloud 66 builds Docker stacks in two ways:

1. **Pulling your code from Git**: This option uses Cloud 66 [BuildGrid](#buildgrid) to build your Docker image, so that you don't have to. You just need to provide a [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/reference/builder/) that specifies how you'd like us to build the image. Once your image is ready, it is pushed to your servers and managed. We also version the image and allow you to download it if needed.
2. **User-provided image**: You provide a Docker image that you've built, which we push to your servers and manage. 

We provide a set of tools and practices to help you run a full end to end production Docker based stack. Cloud 66 Docker includes the following:

<h3 id="lifecycle">Container lifecycle management</h3>
Rolling out your Docker images to your servers, scaling, load balancing, port forwarding, lifecycle management, graceful draining and shutdown of workers, deployment rollbacks.

<h3 id="network">Networking layer</h3>
An internal [Weave](https://github.com/zettio/weave) network that runs across all of your servers, allowing each server _and_ container to have an internal IP address (on the 25.0.0.0 subnet). For example: 

{% highlight bash %}
Server 1 (25.0.0.1) has Container 1 (25.0.0.2)
Server 2 (25.0.0.3) has Container 1 (25.0.0.4) and Container 2 (25.0.0.5)
Server 3 (25.0.0.6) has Container 1 (25.0.0.7) and Container 2 (25.0.0.8)
{% endhighlight %}

Containers can communicate with each other using the private address (on any port), regardless of the physical server the other container resides on. In other words, containers can communicate as if they were on the same server. The networking layer transparently maps between the two.

<h3 id="dns">DNS</h3>
An internal DNS service which assigns a DNS record to each of your Docker services and servers. For example, you can connect to your MySQL instance on `mysql.cloud66.local`, and this record will update automatically in case you switch your server. Services can be found at `service_name.cloud66.local`, and will use round-robin if you have more than one container for a service.

<h3 id="buildgrid">BuildGrid</h3>
When building your Docker stack, you can either provide us with your own image, or let us create them for you with our powerful cluster of servers called BuildGrid. Your image is created based on your source code and a Dockerfile, which specifies how you want it to be created. 

Using BuildGrid lets you focus on what you do best and avoids you having to create internal processes to output Docker images. You can even integrate your CI solution, so that new images are built and pushed to your servers once all your tests pass. 

<h3 id="registry">Registry</h3>
Any images created with BuildGrid are made available through Registry.

Docker-based stacks enjoy the same benefits as other Cloud 66 stacks, including: 

- Deployed and managed databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis as well as non-database components like ElasticSearch and RabbitMQ)
- Database managed and verified backups and replication
- Nginx and load balancing
- Firewall management and brute force protection for web and SSH
- Team and organisations (ACL)
- Fast response 100% SLA DNS layer (ElasticAddress) for quick traffic switch overs
- Server vital sign metrics
- Intuitive UI
- API and command line

<h2 id="building">Building your first Docker stack</h2>
<h3 id="what">What youâ€™ll need</h3>

<ul class="list">
  <li><a href="https://app.cloud66.com/users/sign_up" target="_blank">Cloud 66 account</a></li>
  <li>A source for your service(s)
    <ul class="list" style="margin-bottom=0px">
      <li>Pull your code from Git (with a <a href="https://docs.docker.com/reference/builder/">Dockerfile</a>)</li>
      <li>Provide an existing Docker image</li>
    </ul>   
  </li>  
  <li><a href="/deployment/deploy-to-your-cloud">Deployment credentials</a>
    <ul class="list">
      <li>The API key for your cloud provider (<a href="/deployment/deploy-to-your-cloud">add a cloud platform</a>)</li>
      <li>An SSH key and IP address for your server (<a href="/deployment/deploy-to-your-own-server">add a SSH key</a>)</li>
    </ul> 
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="1">Step 1: Build your stack</h3>
Before you can deploy your applications to a server with Cloud 66, you must build a stack of the web applications components your application needs to run. To build your first stack, complete the following steps.

<div class="notice notice">
  <h3>Note</h3>
    <p>Docker stacks are currently running in beta.</p>
</div>

<ol class="list">
<li>Sign in to Cloud 66.</li>
<li>On the Cloud 66 dashboard, click <i>Build a Docker stack</i>.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="2">Step 2: Services configuration</h3>
Now provide a stack name, and the environment you would like to deploy in. Next up is configuring your Docker services - for example _web_, _api_, _worker_ and so on. You can add as many services to your stack as you need. These are the available fields:

<ol class="list">
<li>What's the service name?</li>
<li>How shall we build this service?</li>
    <ul class="list">
      <li><b>Pull code from Git:</b> Cloud 66 builds your Docker images for you using BuildGrid, which requires that you place a Dockerfile in your repository.</li>
      <li><b>Build from Docker image:</b> Specify your own Docker image repository for us to pull your image from.</li>
    </ul> 
<li>Is the service accessible from the Internet? If so, specify which port your container runs on.</li>  
<li>Which database(s) do you need?</li>  
</ol>

This page has _basic_ and _advanced_ configurations, designated by the tabs at the top of the form. Switching between the tabs will retain any previous information provided. The advanced tab allows you to input more detailed settings, which you can learn about in [Advanced Docker deployments](/beta/advanced-docker-deployments).

<h3 id="3">Step 3: Define deployment properties</h3>
Complete the following steps to define the properties that determine how to deploy your application.

<b>Prerequisites</b><br/>
If deploying to a cloud server, you must know the API key for your cloud provider. If deploying to your server, you must have (or generate) a SSH key for the server. For instructions on generating an SSH key, refer to [Setting up SSH keys](http://community.cloud66.com/articles/setting-up-ssh-keys).

<ol class="list">
  <li>In the <i>Where are you deploying to</i> dialog box, select the deployment target to use.</li>
  <li>Perform one of the following actions, depending on your deployment configuration:
    <ul class="list">
      <li>If deploying to a cloud, select the cloud provider, server region and server size.</li>
      <li>If deploying to a server, enter your username and IP address.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>   
  <li>In the <i>Deployment details</i> dialog box, select the database option to use.</li>
  <li>Click <i>Deploy</i>.</li>
</ol>

This page has also has _basic_ and _advanced_ configurations, designated by the tabs at the top of the form. Switching between the tabs will retain any previous information provided. The advanced tab allows you to input more detailed settings, which you can learn about in [Advanced Docker deployments](/beta/advanced-docker-deployments).

<h3 id="4">Step 4: Review the deployment logs</h3>
After your stack builds successfully, you can view the log generated by the deployment.

<h3 id="5">What's next?</h3>
Your stack is up and running - you now have:

- Docker servers with automated deployment and lifecycle management
- Networking and DNS layer across your stack
- Database layer
- Load balancing layer
- All other Cloud 66 features, such as security, managed Nginx, team management and so on.
