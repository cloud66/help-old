## About using Rackspace cloud
## Add Rackspace keys to a stack

You can use Cloud 66 to provision and deploy your code to servers in any Rackspace [region](/api/basics/instance-regions.html#rackspace). All you need to do is add your Rackspace API keys to your Cloud 66 account.

Visit the Rackspace <a href="https://manage.rackspacecloud.com/pages/Login.jsp" target="_blank">US</a> or <a href="https://mycloud.rackspace.co.uk" target="_blank">EU</a> site to learn more about their offering and sign up for their services.

Once you have signed up, please add your API keys to your account while [building a new stack](/getting-started/your-first-stack.html):
