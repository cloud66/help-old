<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
You can use Cloud 66 to provision and deploy your code to servers in any [Amazon Web Services region](/api/basics/instance-regions.html#aws). All you need to do is add your Amazon API keys to your Cloud 66 account.

You can find these keys under <i>Security Credentials</i> in the top right menu of your AWS Management Console:

![aws](http://cdn.cloud66.com/images/help/aws_menu.png)

Your key and secret are available on that page:

![aws](http://cdn.cloud66.com/images/help/aws_credentials.png)

Once you have those credentials, please add them to your account while [building a new stack](/getting-started/your-first-stack.html):

![cloud connect](http://cdn.cloud66.com/images/help/cloud_connect.png)

<div class="notice notice-warning">
    <h3>Notice</h3>
    <p>Should you wish to delete your stack on Cloud 66, your servers <b>will not</b> be deleted on your cloud provider.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="reserved">Reserved instances</h2>
[AWS reserved instances](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/purchasing-options/reserved-instances/) enable users of EC2 or RDS to reserve instances for one to three years, which has pricing benefits when compared to on-demand instances.

It's very simple to use Cloud 66 with AWS reserved instances: start by reserving an instance with your size/region requirements. Now, simply use Cloud 66 to deploy to a server of that size in the same region, and we'll use your reserved instance.

<h2 id="vpc">Classic and VPC platforms</h2>
You can choose to create servers in both the [Classic and VPC platforms](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-vpc.html). To use a VPC, your account must conform with the [default VPC guidelines](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/default-vpc.html#launching-into). 

Certain instances types, such as the T2, require the use of VPC. 

<h2 id="iam">IAM credentials</h2>
If you are using [AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)](http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/iam/), we recommend that you set up a user for Cloud 66 so that you can control the access to your AWS account with more granularity.
