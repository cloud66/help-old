lead: Use your Amazon Web Services account with Cloud 66
---

You can use Cloud 66 to provision and deploy your code to servers on Amazon Web Services. All you need to do is add your Amazon API keys to your Cloud 66 account.

You can find these keys under <i>Security Credentials</i> in the top right menu of your AWS Management Console:

![aws](http://cdn.cloud66.com.s3.amazonaws.com/images/help/aws_menu.png)

Your key and secret are available on that page:

![aws](http://cdn.cloud66.com.s3.amazonaws.com/images/help/aws_credentials.png)

Once you have those credentials, please add them to your account while [building a new stack](/getting-started/your-first-stack.html):

![cloud connect](http://cdn.cloud66.com.s3.amazonaws.com/images/help/cloud_connect.png)

<div class="notice notice-warning">
    <h3>Notice</h3>
    <p>Should you wish to delete your stack on Cloud 66, your servers <b>will not</b> be deleted on your cloud provider.</p>
</div>

## IAM Credentials
If you are using [AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)](http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/iam/), we recommend that you set up a user for Cloud 66 so that you can control the access to your AWS account with more granularity.
