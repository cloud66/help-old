You can use Cloud 66 to provision and deploy your code to servers on DigitalOcean. All you need to do is add your DigitalOcean API keys to your Cloud 66 account.

You can find these keys under the <i>API</i> selection on the left menu of your DigitalOcean account.

Once you have those credentials, please add them to your account while [building a new stack](/getting-started/your-first-stack.html):

<div class="notice notice-warning">
    <h3>Notice</h3>
    <p>Should you wish to delete your stack on Cloud 66, your servers <b>will not</b> be deleted on your cloud provider.</p>

## Private networking
DigitalOcean private networking is enabled for all data centers that support it. This means that servers can communicate freely between each other on the same network without counting towards bandwidth costs.
