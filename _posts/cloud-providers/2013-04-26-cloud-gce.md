<h2 id="activation">Introduction</h2>
You can use Cloud 66 to provision and deploy your code to servers in any [Google Compute Engine (GCE) region](/api/basics/instance-regions.html#gce). All you need to do is add your GCE API key to your Cloud 66 account.

You will have the option to add your GCE credentials when building your first stack:

This screen will allow you to add your client email, project ID and key. We will explain how to retrieve these from GCE below.

Within your [GCE developers console](https://console.developers.google.com/project) for a specific project, within the _APIs & auth_ menu, click _Credentials_. On that page, you'll be able to _Create a new client ID_:

Next, you'll want to create a _Service account_, which will allow Cloud 66 to provision servers in your GCE on your behalf.

Once you click _Create client ID_, GCE will provide you with a P12 private key and display your service account details:

Finally, adding your _client email_, _project name_ and _P12 key_ to Cloud 66, you'll be able to deploy to GCE through Cloud 66:
