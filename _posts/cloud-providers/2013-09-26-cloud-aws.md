    Use Cloud 66 to provision and deploy your code to your own servers running under your Amazon Web Services account

## Connecting to Cloud 66
You can find your Amazon API keys under Security Credentials on the top right menu in AWS Management Console.

## IAM Credentials
If you are using [AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)](http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/iam/) we recommend setting up a user for Cloud 66 so you can control the access to your AWS account better.
