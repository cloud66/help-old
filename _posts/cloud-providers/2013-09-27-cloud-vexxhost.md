Our partnership with [VEXXHOST](http://www.vexxhost.com) allows you to deploy your applications to your cloud compute account.

<div class="notice notice">
  <h3>Notice</h3>
  <p>It is important to note that you can only deploy to the VEXXHOST <a href="http://vexxhost.com/cloud-computing">cloud computing</a> service and not their <a href="http://vexxhost.com/cloud_servers">cloud servers</a> platform. This is because their API only allows access to their cloud computing service.</p>
</div>

If you already have a cloud servers account, you can ask their support team to switch your account to the cloud compute platform, which involves no downtime and no data loss at all.

To get started at VEXXHOST, you will need to create your account by signing up to their [cloud compute](http://vexxhost.com/cloud-computing) service. They require a credit card to open your account, which is used for verification.

Once you've completed the sign up process, your account will be setup automatically.  When you finish the sign up process, the system will automatically redirect you to your cloud control panel, where you can click on [API credentials](https://secure.vexxhost.com/billing/cloud.php?__cloud_path=credentials/) to get your details.

![API Credentials](http://cdn.cloud66.com/images/help/vexxhost_creds.png "API Credentials")

From that page, you will require your username and API key.   Please make sure to store this information safely as it provides full API access to your cloud computing account, which means that if someone gains access to it, they will be able to create/delete/modify your servers.

Once you have completed the sign up process and you would like to start deploying your application to the VEXXHOST cloud, you will need to add your username and API key to your Cloud 66 account while [building a new stack](http://help.cloud66.com/getting-started/your-first-stack.html).
