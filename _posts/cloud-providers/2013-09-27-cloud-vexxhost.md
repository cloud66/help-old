Our partnership with VEXXHOST allows you to deploy your Ruby applications onto your cloud compute account by only providing your API credentials inside our system.

<div class="notice notice">
  <h3>Notice</h3>
  <p>It is important to note that you can deploy only to their <a href="http://vexxhost.com/cloud-computing">cloud computing</a> service and not on their <a href="http://vexxhost.com/cloud_servers">cloud servers</a> platform.  The reason behind this is that you only get API access when you sign up with their cloud computing service</p>
</div>

You can ask their support team to switch your account from the cloud servers platform to the cloud compute platform if you are already using cloud servers.  This process involves no downtime and no data loss at all.

In order to get started at VEXXHOST, you will need to create your account by signing up to their [cloud compute](http://vexxhost.com/cloud-computing) service.  You will require you a credit card to open your account, however, it will not be charged and it will only be used for verification.

Once you've completed the sign up process, your account will be setup automatically.  When you finish the sign up process, the system will automatically redirect you to your cloud control panel, where you can click on the [API credentials](https://secure.vexxhost.com/billing/cloud.php?__cloud_path=credentials/) to get your details.

From that page, you will require your username and API key.   Please make sure to store this information safely as it provides full API access to your cloud computing account which means that if someone gains access to it, they will be able to create/delete/modify your servers.

Once you have completed the sign up process and you would like to start deploying your application to the VEXXHOST cloud, you will need to add your username and API key to your Cloud 66 account while [building a new stack](http://help.cloud66.com/getting-started/your-first-stack.html).
