## Stack links

To make life easier for you, the Cloud 66 toolbelt <b>detects the Git URL and branch for each directory it is run in</b>. As such,
you won't have to specify which stack you want to run the toolbelt on if you're in the git folder and branch of one of your stacks.

## Auto-complete

Follow our [instructions](https://github.com/cloud66/cx/wiki/Setting-up-Auto-complete-for-the-toolbelt) to add an auto-complete feature to your toolbelt, which will make typing commands out by hand much quicker.
