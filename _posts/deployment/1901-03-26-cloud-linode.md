## About using Linode cloud
## Add Linode keys to a stack

You can use Cloud 66 to provision and deploy your code to servers in any Linode [region](/api/basics/instance-regions.html#linode). All you need to do is add your Linode API keys to your Cloud 66 account.

Please visit Linode to learn more about their <a href="http://www.linode.com/avail/" target="_blank">regions</a> and <a href="https://manager.linode.com/signup/#plans" target="_blank">Linode pricing</a>

    <h3>Note</h3>
    <p>Linode private networking is automatically enabled for all servers deployed by Cloud 66. This means that servers can communicate freely between each other on the same network without counting towards bandwidth costs.</p>

Once you have signed up, please add your API keys to your account while [building a new stack](/getting-started/your-first-stack.html):
