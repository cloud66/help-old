## About scaling web servers (horizontal vs vertical)
You can fire up additional web servers by clicking on the "+" button on the <i>Web servers</i> page.

<div class="notice">
		<h3>Important</h3>
		<p>This feature is only available if you have deployed using your cloud provider and you have added a <a href="/add-ins/load-balancer.html">load balancer</a> to your stack.</p>

Your new server(s) will be added to your load balancer automatically after they have completed provisioning and deployment - ready to serve traffic!

If you are using AWS, you can choose to scale your servers to different [Availability Zones](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html) within your region:

#### Scale down your web servers
If you have scaled up additional web servers to deal with increased traffic, you can always scale down again. Simply click on the _X_ button next to the server you want to shut down. This server will automatically be removed from your load balancer and terminated from your cloud provider.
Note that your primary (initially created) web server cannot be destroyed.

A number of cloud vendors allow you to scale up/down an existing server via their control panel, allowing you to increase or decrease the memory and CPU for existing servers.

Cloud 66 is compatible with this behaviour, and this is how you would go about accomplishing this:

- Shut down the server through your cloud vendor dashboard
- Change its size and start it up
- Wait 5 to 10 minutes for us to pick up the change, at which point you will be asked to redeploy

Please note that if you have a load balancer and are using AWS as your cloud vendor, this is slightly more complex. AWS load balancers use a unique identifier
for each server, which is updated when you change the size of the server.

Scaling vertically on AWS with the instructions above will therefore only work with backend servers but not app servers, as these are served via the
load balancer. For app servers, we recommend that you [scale up a new server](/stack-features/horizontal-scaling.html) (with your desired size) and then delete the old one.
