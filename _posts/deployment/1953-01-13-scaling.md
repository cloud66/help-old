<h2 id="about">About scaling servers</h2>
You can scale your servers in two ways: horizontal and vertical. Horizontal scaling involves adding more servers, whereas vertical scaling involves altering the resources of a specific server, for example increasing the server size.

<h2 id="horizontal">Horizontal scaling</h2>
Horizontal scaling works differently for each server type, and is only available if you have deployed using your cloud provider.

<h3 id="web">Web servers</h3>
To scale up your web servers, start by adding a load balancer to your stack, which will distribute traffic to your servers. Next, from your stack detail page, click the link to your web server group (eg. Rails server). To add a web server, click _Scale up_ in the top right corner, select your desired server size and quantity, and click _Scale up_. Your new server(s) will automatically be added to the load balancer after they have completed provisioning and deployment, ready to serve traffic.

If you are using AWS, you will also have the option to scale your servers to different [Availability Zones](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html) within your region.

You can also scale down your web servers. From your stack detail page, click the link to your web server group (eg. Rails server), and click the _X_ icon next to the server you would like to scale down. This server will automatically be removed from your load balancer, but you will need to delete it from your cloud provider. Note that your primary web server cannot be scaled down, because this would leave you without a web server.

<h3 id="process">Process servers</h3>
When you first build your stack, your processes are run on your web server by default. To scale up a process server, click the link to your _Process server_ group on your stack detail page. Next, click _New process server_ in the top right corner, select the desired server size and quantity, and click _Scale up_.

Once the server is ready, you can move your processes from the web server to the process server by using the <i>+</i> and <i>-</i> buttons. The process server is very much like a web server, as it needs all the code and dependencies for your workers. By default however, it will not serve web content. If you would like the process server to serve web content, add a load balancer to your stack and access the load balancer page. This page allows you to toggle serving web content from a process server _On_ and _Off_.

<h3 id="db">Database servers</h3>
You can scale your database servers through database replication. See our [database management section](/database-management/database-management.html) for more information.

<h2 id="vertical">Vertical scaling</h2>
A number of cloud vendors allow you to increase and/or decrease the size of an existing server via their dashboard, allowing you to change the memory and CPU for existing servers. Vertical scaling works the same way for all server types.

Follow these steps to scale your server vertically:

1. Shut down the server through your cloud dashboard
2. Change the server size and start it up
3. Wait 5 to 10 minutes for Cloud 66 to identify the change, at which point you will be asked to redeploy

Note that if you have a load balancer and are using AWS as your cloud vendor, this is slightly more complex. AWS load balancers use a unique identifier
for each server, which is updated when you change the size of the server.

Scaling vertically on AWS with the instructions above will therefore only work with backend servers but not app servers, as these are served via the
load balancer. For application servers, we recommend that you scale up a new server (with your desired size) and delete the old one.
