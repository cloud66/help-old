<h2 id="assign">Assigning environment variables</h2>

#### Before stack build

Aside from [environment variables that are auto-generated by Cloud 66](/stack-features/deploy-hooks.html#hooks), you can assign your own before your initial stack build.

![environment variables](http://cdn.cloud66.com/images/help/environment_vars.png)

This menu will allow you to either manually enter or upload a file containing your environment variables, in the following format:
<pre class="terminal">
KEY&#95;1=value&#95;1
KEY&#95;2=value&#95;2
# comment line
KEY&#95;3=value&#95;3
</pre>

#### After stack build

You can also assign your environment variables on an existing stack by clicking the settings icon:

![environment variables](http://cdn.cloud66.com/images/help/environment_vars_menu.png)

<div class="notice">
    <h3>Important</h3>
    <p>You need to redeploy your stack for environment variable changes to take effect.</p>
</div>

Please be aware of the following while assigning environment variables:

- <b>Environment variables are not escaped</b><br/>
However, they are always wrapped in double quotes (eg. <kbd>"ENV_VAR"</kbd>) so you can use them with multi-line variables like SSH keys.
- <b>Some environment variables cannot be modified</b><br/>
For example, environment variables for your server IP addresses cannot be changed because they are automatically set and updated based on reported IP addresses.
- <b>You can reference other environment variables on the same stack</b><br/>
This can be done using the <kbd>&#123;&#123; ENV&#95;VAR &#125;&#125;</kbd> syntax, and is useful when referencing an environment variable which you don't control such as a server IP address.
- <b>You can reference environment variables available on other stacks</b><br/>
This is done using the <kbd>&#123;&#123; STACK[STACK_UID].ENV&#95;VAR &#125;&#125;</kbd> syntax. Your stack UID is available on the stack setting page.

<div class="notice">
  <h3>Note</h3>
  <p>You need administrative privileges on the target stack to reference environment variables on it.</p>
  <p>You cannot use intra-stack environment variables to gain access to database credentials, only database addresses.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="using">Using environment variables</h2>
Instead of hard-coding credentials, many developers use environment variables to store database username and passwords, which can then be referenced elsewhere.

Referencing environment variables is done differently depending on your application settings, but these are some examples.

- <b>Bash scripts</b>
<pre class="terminal">$ENV_VAR</pre>
- <b>.YML files</b><br/>
<pre class="terminal">username: &lt;%= ENV['DB&#95;USER'] %&gt;</pre>
- <b>.RB files</b><br/>
<pre class="terminal">working_directory "#{ENV['STACK_PATH']}"</pre>

<h2 id="auto-gen">Auto-generated environment variables</h2>
These auto-generated environment variables are in addition to any that you assign yourself. To see a list of environment variables available to your stack, please access your environment variable page.

<div class="notice">
    <h3>Important</h3>
    <p>Given that we frequently add new features and frameworks, this is by no means an exhaustive list of auto-generated environment variables.</p>
</div>

#### Standard Environment Variables

- **RAILS&#95;ENV** &mdash; Your stacks environment
- **RACK&#95;ENV** &mdash; Your stacks environment
- **STACK&#95;PATH** &mdash; The directory path to which your code is deployed

#### Stack-specific environment variables

Depending on your stack configuration, Cloud 66 will set (and update) environment variables for you. For example, if you have a MySQL server, the following variables will be assigned:

- **MYSQL&#95;ADDRESS** &mdash; The physical address of your MySQL server (kept up-to-date)

Note: If you have not already specified your own corresponding database username and password, one or both of the following will be created:

- **MYSQL&#95;USERNAME** &mdash; Randomly assigned and inserted into your database.yml file
- **MYSQL&#95;PASSWORD** &mdash; Randomly assigned and inserted into your database.yml file
