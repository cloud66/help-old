<h2 id="about">About using Packet cloud</h2>
You can use Cloud 66 to provision and deploy your code to servers in [Packet](https://www.packet.net/).

<h2 id="add">Adding your Packet credentials</h2>
Visit the Cloud 66 Dashboard and select _Get started building a stack_. After connecting to your Git repository and analyzing your code, you will be asked to _Add your cloud platform_. From this menu, select _Packet_ and provide your Packet API Key from _API Keys_ on your _Packet Dashboard_.
