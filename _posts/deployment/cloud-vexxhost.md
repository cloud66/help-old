<h2 id="about">About using Vexxhost cloud</h2>
Our partnership with [VEXXHOST](http://www.vexxhost.com) allows you to deploy your applications to your cloud compute account. It is important to note that you can only deploy to the VEXXHOST <a href="http://vexxhost.com/cloud-computing">cloud computing</a> service and not their <a href="http://vexxhost.com/cloud_servers">cloud servers</a> platform. This is because their API only allows access to their cloud computing service.

If you already have a cloud servers account, you can ask their support team to switch your account to the cloud compute platform, which involves no downtime and no data loss at all.

<h2 id="gen">Generate Vexxhost API keys</h2>
You need to provide your Vexxhost API keys in order for Cloud 66 to access your account. To generate these, click the _CloudConsole_ link in their dashboard, and then _API Credentials_ in the left menu. You will need the _API Username_ and _API Password_.

<h2 id="add">Add Vexxhost key to a stack</h2>
Visit the Cloud 66 Dashboard and select _Get started building a stack_. After connecting to your Git repository and analyzing your code, you will be asked to _Add your cloud platform_. From this menu, select _Vexxhost_ and provide your API keys.

    <p>Should you wish to delete your stack on Cloud 66, your servers <b>will not</b> be deleted on your cloud provider.</p>
