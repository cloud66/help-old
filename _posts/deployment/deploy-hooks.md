<h1 id="what">What are deploy hooks?</h1>
<p>Deploy hooks are scripts that allow you to take action at various points during the deployment process. This helps you customize the deployment of your application to meet your particular needs.</p>

<div class="notice">
    <h3>Important</h3>
    <p>Deploy hooks currently only apply to Rack-based stacks, not Docker stacks.</p>
</div>

<hr />

<h1 id="points">Hook points</h1>
<p>The deployment process is divided into a number of steps, and hook points allow you to intervene at various points during this process.</p>

<table class="table table-bordered table-striped table-small">
<tr>
	<td><b>Hook point</b></td>
	<td><b>Description</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>first&#95;thing</td>
	<td>The first thing (after after_checkout) that will happen on the server. A common use-case for this hook is to install packages to run your application.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>after&#95;checkout</td>
	<td>When we create your server, your code is pulled directly from Git to it. Use this hook if you want to make a change to your code after it is pulled (but before anything else). Happens during the code deployment of your application.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>before&#95;<i>x</i></td>
	<td>This hook will run before a server component is installed on your server. Accepted values for <i>x</i>: <i>redis</i>, <i>mysql</i>, <i>postgresql</i>, <i>mongodb</i></td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>after&#95;<i>x</i></td>
	<td>This hook will run after a server component is installed on your server. Accepted values for <i>x</i>: <i>redis</i>, <i>mysql</i>, <i>postgresql</i>, <i>mongodb</i></td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>before&#95;rails</td>
	<td>This hook will run before Rails is installed on your server.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>after&#95;bundle</td>
	<td>This hook will run after bundle but before other rake tasks, such as database migrations. Happens during the code deployment of your application.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>after&#95;symlink</td>
	<td>Runs after the symbolic link to your current code folder has been created. <br /><br />Happens during the code deployment of your application.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>after&#95;rails</td>
	<td>This hook will run after Rails (and everything web related) is installed on your server.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>before&#95;agent</td>
	<td>This hook will run before the Cloud 66 agent is installed on your server.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>after&#95;agent</td>
	<td>This hook will run after the Cloud 66 agent is installed on your server.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>last&#95;thing</td>
	<td>This hook will run as the last thing that happens on your server.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Deploy hook scripts that contain <code>$STACK_PATH</code> and occur before the <i>after_symlink</i> hook point will cause permission errors during deployment, because the symbolic link has not yet been created.</p>

<p>However, youâ€™re free to use <code>$STACK_PATH</code> as a source and/or destination for your deploy hook files before the <i>after_symlink</i> hook point.</p>

<hr />

<h1 id="fields">Hook fields</h1>
<p>There are three types of deploy hooks, and the fields available (and required) vary by type:</p>

<ol class="list">
<li><b>Snippets:</b> use pre-existing scripts to install common packages. These snippets are <a href="https://github.com/cloud66/snippets">open source</a>, and are created by Cloud 66 or third parties.</li>
<li><b>Commands:</b> run your own commands.</li>
<li><b>Scripts:</b> use your own scripts for more comprehensive procedures.</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="how">How to use deploy hooks</h1>
To make use of deploy hooks, a file called _deploy_hooks.yml_ should be present within a folder named <i>.cloud66</i>, which is in turn located in the root of your source code. This file should be YAML formatted, and you can use a service like <a href="http://yamllint.com/" target="_blank">YAMLlint</a> to validate it.

<pre class="prettyprint">
/.cloud66/deploy_hooks.yml
</pre>

Creating a deploy hook from scratch consists of a number of steps:<br/>

<ol class="list">
<li>Choose your environment - eg. example <i>production</i>, <i>development</i>, <i>staging</i> and so on.</li>
<li>Choose your hook point - eg. <i>first_thing</i>, <i>after_rails</i> and so on.</li>
<li>Choose your deploy hook type - eg. <i>snippet</i>, <i>command</i> or <i>script</i>.</li>
<li>Select any additional hook fields you require</li>
</ol>

Automating deploy hooks can sometimes be tricky. To avoid issues, it's good practice to run each of your commands manually to see that they complete successfully. If a specific command doesn't show any output, you can use the <code>echo $?</code> command after issuing your command to see its exit code. If it returns a <i>zero</i>, your command was successful, whereas a <i>one</i> means it has failed.

<h2 id="snippets">Use a snippet deploy hook</h2>
Below is a bare-bone example of using a snippet with the required fields - it will execute the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloud66/snippets/master/cloud66/node">Cloud 66 Node snippet</a> as the first thing on all production servers.

<pre class="prettyprint">
production: # Environment
    first_thing: # Hook point
      - snippet: cloud66/node # Hook type
        target: any # Hook fields
        execute: true
</pre>

See the available hook points and fields for more ways to customize this.

<h2 id="commands">Use a command deploy hook</h2>
The hook example below can be used to install anything from packages to fonts on your server.

<pre class="prettyprint">
production: # Environment
    first_thing: # Hook point
      - command: apt-get install curl -y # Hook type
        target: any # Hook fields
        execute: true
</pre>

<div class="notice">
    <h3>Important</h3>
    <p>When automating the installation of packages, remember to use the <i>-y</i> flag to answer yes to all prompts.</p>
</div>

The example below can be used to run custom rake tasks during server build. If you need to run it more than once, consider using the <a href="/stack-add-ins/rake-task">rake task add-in</a>.

<pre class="prettyprint">
production: # Environment
    last_thing: # Hook point
      - command: cd $STACK_PATH &amp;&amp; bundle exec rake dev:setup # Hook type
        target: rails # Hook fields â†“
        run_on: single_server
        apply_during: build_only
</pre>

This will run our rake task on one Rails server and only during the initial build. We run this as a last_thing hook because if we ran it earlier the application wouldn't exist on the server and be usable.

<h2 id="scripts">Use a script deploy hook</h2>
The hook below will copy a file from your repository to your <i>tmp</i> folder and execute it during build.

<pre class="prettyprint">
production: # Environment
    after_rails: # Hook point
      - source: /.cloud66/script.sh # Hook type
        destination: /tmp/script.sh
        target: rails # Hook fields â†“
        execute: true
        apply_during: build_only
</pre>
