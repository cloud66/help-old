---

In a nutshell, Cloud 66 builds your [full stack](LINK) on either your [cloud servers](LINK) or [your own](LINK), deploys your app to them and manages it for you.
Whether you are a running a small hobby project or work in a large team of developers, Cloud 66 helps you focus on what you do best.

Cloud 66 is provided as a service, so you don't need to install anything on your local machine. These are a selection of the features we provide:

- <b>Deploy</b> your application to your cloud or your own servers
- <b>Backup</b> your databases at set intervals
- <b>Scale</b> your web, database, and process servers with the click of a button
- <b>Security</b> features such as intruder detection and firewall
- <b>Monitor</b> your servers
- And much more...

To get started, you just have to provide us with a Git URL to your repository. We'll then analyze your code and build a stack based on it.
