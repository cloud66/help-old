## 2. Accessing your code
If you have a <b>private Git repository</b>, please add the unique SSH key provided to your Git account. If you have a <b>public repository</b>, feel free to jump to the next step.

## 3. Tell us about your app
Provide us with a [URL to your Git repository](/how-to/git-url.html), give your stack a name and select which [environment to deploy](/stack-features/stack-envs.html).

## 4. Cloud 66 gets to work
Cloud 66 will then analyze your application, which takes around 15 seconds depending on the size of repository.

## 5. Choose your setup
You are now shown the results of our analysis, and you can choose how you would like to setup your stack.

## 6. Let the builders work
Cloud 66 now gets to work and fires up servers in your cloud (or provisions your own servers). We then configure your servers based on our analysis and deploy your application to them.

## 7. You're done!
It's done. You now have a fully working stack with your application running, and are free to manage it with [backups](/add-ins/backups.html), [scaling](/stack-features/horizontal-scaling.html), [security](/getting-started/security.html) and so on.
