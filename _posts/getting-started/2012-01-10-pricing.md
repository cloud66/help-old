As with other cloud providers, you only pay for what you use at Cloud 66, and there are no setup fees or fixed term contracts.

Our pricing is simple - it's US$ 9 per server per month, which goes down to US$ 7 if you pay annually. Additionally, <b>all development stacks are free</b>.

## Billing cycle

The billing cycle for your account is every 30 days, and your account charges are calculated on an hourly basis. Your account will be charged for the accumulated amount you've accrued during the last 30 days at the end of each cycle.

## How can I use Cloud 66 for my side projects?

You can use Cloud 66 to deploy and manage your 'side projects' by placing a Cloud 66 badge on your homepage to get one free production server.
