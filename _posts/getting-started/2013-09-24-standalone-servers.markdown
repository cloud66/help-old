    Use your own servers with Cloud 66
</p>


You can always use your own servers with Cloud 66 as long as they run meet the ([OS requirements](/help/operating_system)) and are accessible to our servers.

That said, you should [depoy to your cloud provider](/help/cloud_providers) if you would like to take advantage of:

- Load Balancing
- One-Click Scaling
