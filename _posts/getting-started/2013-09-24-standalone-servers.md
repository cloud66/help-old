You can always use your own servers with Cloud 66 as long as they run meet the ([OS requirements](/stacks/operating-system-information.html)) and are accessible to our servers.

That said, you should [deploy to a cloud provider](/cloud-providers/supported-cloud-providers.html) if you would like to take advantage of:

- Load Balancing
- One-Click Scaling
