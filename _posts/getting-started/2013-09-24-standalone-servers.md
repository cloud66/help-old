You're welcome to use your own servers with Cloud 66. They just need to be [accessible to our service](LINK) and meet our [operating system requirements](/stacks/operating-system-information.html).

![bring your own server](http://cdn.cloud66.com.s3.amazonaws.com/images/help/byos.png)

However, given that we don't know anything about your local infrastructure (as we do with cloud vendors), our service offering is limited in the following regards:

- Scaling your application
- Load balancing
- Intruder detection

For the best experience possible, we strongly recommend that you [deploy to your cloud](/getting-started/supported-clouds.html).
