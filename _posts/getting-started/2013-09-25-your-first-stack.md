## 1. Start a Stack
Go to the <a href="https://www.cloud66.com/dashboard" target="_blank">Cloud 66 Dashboard</a> and click 'Build Stack'.

## 2. Accessing Your Code
Add your unique SSH key to your Git repository. This will allow Cloud 66 to analyze your code and suggest the stack configuration to deploy.

## 3. Tell Us About Your App
Simply point Cloud 66 to your Git repository and give your stack a name.

## 4. Cloud 66 Gets to Work
Cloud 66 now analyzes your app. This takes around 10 - 15 seconds.

## 5. Last Stop Before Cloud
Now Cloud 66 shows you the results of the analysis and how it is going to build your full stack.

## 6. Let the Builders Work
Cloud 66 now gets to work and fires up servers in your cloud (or provisions your own servers). It then configures the servers and deploys your app to them.

## 7. You Are Done!
It's done. You now have a fully working stack with your app running. You can now see some tips on the stack if you would like to to add load balancing, SSL or backups and more to your stack. It's all done in one place.
