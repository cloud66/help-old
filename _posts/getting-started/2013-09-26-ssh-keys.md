<p class="lead">SSH keys handle the complete authentication process and do not require you to enter a password to connect to your server</p>

<p>Authentication keys come in two parts:</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		<p>
			<strong>Public Key</strong> &mdash; stored in the <kbd>~/.ssh/authorized&#95;keys</kbd> file of the server that you want to access.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			<strong>Private Key</strong> &mdash; stored on your machine in the <kbd>~/.ssh/</kbd> directory. This allows you to gain access to any machine with the public key.
		</p>
	</li>
</ol>

## Generate Keys on Linux and Mac

<p>Run the <kbd>ssh-keygen</kbd> command in the terminal and answer the questions when prompted, the defaults are acceptable for most use cases.</p>

<pre class="terminal">ssh-keygen</pre>

<p>The generated keys should now be located in your home directory <kbd>~/.ssh/</kbd></p>

<ul>
	<li>
		You'll find the <strong>private key</strong> in the <kbd>~/.ssh/id&#95;rsa</kbd> file.
	</li>
	<li>
		You'll find the <strong>public key</strong> in the <kbd>~/.ssh/id&#95;rsa.pub</kbd> file.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Copy the public key into the <kbd>~/.ssh/authorized&#95;keys</kbd> file on your server, using the following commands. Substitute your own SSH user and host names:</p>

<pre class="terminal">scp ~/.ssh/id&#95;rsa.pub squire@example.com:/home/user/.ssh/uploaded&#95;key.pub
ssh squire@example.com "echo `cat ~/.ssh/uploaded&#95;key.pub` >> ~/.ssh/authorized&#95;keys"</pre>

<p>You can now log in to your server using your public key.</p>

		<h3>Important</h3>
		<p>Cloud 66 doesn't currently support password protected keys, so please ensure your key is <strong>not</strong> passworded.</p>
</div>

## Generate Keys on Windows

If you're using PuTTY in Windows for SSH services, you can still use SSH keys. PuTTY can generate keys using the puttygen program, <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/" target="&#95;blank">download PuTTY</a>.

## Generate Keys via Amazon Web Services

<ol class="instruction-list">
	<li><a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/" target="_blank">Open the Amazon EC2 console</a></li>
	<li>
		<p>In the left hand navigation, under Network and Security, click <b>Key Pairs</b>.</p>
		<p><img src="http://cloud66.com/assets/help/aws-key-1.png" alt=""></p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Click <b>Create Key Pair</b>.</p>
		<p><img src="http://cloud66.com/assets/help/aws-key-2.png" alt=""></p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>In the Key Pair dialog, in the Key Pair Name field, type <i>mykeypair</i> for the new key pair and then click Create.</p>
		<p><img src="http://cloud66.com/assets/help/aws-key-3.png" alt=""></p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Download the private key file, which is named <i>mykeypair.pem</i>, and keep it safe.<br>
		You'll need it to access any instances that you launch with this key pair.</p>
	</li>
</ol>
<p>If you need further information please refer to the <a href="http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/gettingstarted/latest/wah-linux/getting-started-create-key-pair.html">Amazon documentation</a>.</p>

## Connect to your server using your key

Simply ensure that your public key contents are included in ~/.ssh/authorized&#95;keys on the target server. Then you should be able to connect with:
<pre class="terminal">ssh {server user}@{server address}</pre>

If you are using a non-standard key name or location, then you can connect to your server using
<pre class="terminal">ssh -i {your private key location} {server user}@{server address}</pre>

<div class="notice">
		<h3>Important</h3>
		<p>In both cases above you should not be asked to provide your password.</p>
</div>

Once you are happy that you can connect to your server with your key, best practice would be to disable access to your server via username/password. However this is up to you and your particular requirements.
