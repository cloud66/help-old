<h2 id="public">Public repositories</h2>
For public Git repositories, you don't need to add the SSH key provided to your Git account. You simply need to provide the Git URL as either

`http://<git provider>/<username>/<repository>.git`<br/>
or <br/>
`git://<git provider>/<username>/<repository>.git`

<div class="notice notice-warning">
    <h3>Notice</h3>
    <p>We do not support the use of HTTPS URLs.</p>
</div>

This URL is often generated by your Git provider automatically.

<h2 id="private">Private repositories</h2>

For Cloud 66 to access your private repository (with read-only access), you first need to add the SSH provided to your Git account. Follow the instructions on the <i>Build stack</i> page:
![accessing git](http://cdn.cloud66.com/images/help/accessing_git.png)

You can add this SSH key to your entire Git account by adding it to your _Account settings_ page, or allow access to a specific repository by adding it as a _Deploy key_ to that repository.

Once this is done, use a Git URL in the following format:

`git@<git provider>:<username>/<repository>.git`

This URL is often generated by your Git provider automatically.
