<p class="lead">There is many options to connect to your database servers. Choose the one that fit well for you.</p>

## Directly

You can connect directly into your database server and invoke a databade console  from here. To do that, please refer to the [terminal connection to servers](/help/shell_to_your_servers) documentation.

## Indirectly

Another way to connect to your database server is to open a firewall port in your database server to allow a remote machine to connect the server. This is possible using the [Stack Security](/help/stack_security) page. Then you can use from your remote machine your preferred database client.
