## Directly

You can connect directly into your database server and invoke a database console  from here. To do that, please refer to the [terminal connection to servers](/how-to/shell-to-your-servers.html) documentation.

## Indirectly

Another way to connect to your database server is to open a firewall port in your database server to allow a remote machine to connect the server. This is possible using the [Stack Security](/stack-features/stack-security.html) page. Then you can use from your remote machine your preferred database client.
