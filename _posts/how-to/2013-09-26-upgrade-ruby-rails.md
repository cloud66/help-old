If you want to upgrade your Ruby or Rails version on existing Cloud 66 stack, you will need to deploy a new stack.

Make sure that you upgrade your Ruby and Rails applications with [best practises](http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/upgrading_ruby_on_rails.html), and don't forget to choose the right Ruby version when creating the new stack.
