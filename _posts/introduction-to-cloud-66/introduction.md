<h2 id="cloud66">What is Cloud 66?</h2>

Cloud 66 builds your full stack on either your own servers or cloud servers, deploys your application to them, and manages it for you.
Whether you are a running a small hobby project or work in a large team of developers, Cloud 66 helps you focus on what you do best.

Because Cloud 66 is provided as a service, you don't need to install anything on your local machine. Some of the features we provide include:

- <b>Deploying</b> your application to your cloud or your own servers
- <b>Backing up</b> your databases at set intervals
- <b>Scaling</b> your web, database, and process servers with the click of a button
- <b>Securing</b> your servers with features such as intruder detection and firewall
- <b>Monitoring</b> your servers

To get started, you just have to provide us with a Git URL to your repository. We'll then analyze your code and build a stack based on it.

Before you get get started, you may want to look at our Technical specifications to determine if you're ready for Cloud 66.

<h2 id="1">Step 1. Build your stack</h2>
Before you can deploy your applications to a server with Cloud 66, you must build a stack of the web applications components your application needs to run. To build your first stack, complete the following steps.

1. Sign in to Cloud 66.
2. On the Cloud 66 dashboard, click <i>Get started building a stack</i>.

<h2 id="2">Step 2. Access your Git repository</h2>
If you have a private Git repository, complete the following steps to generate the keys needed to access your repository. If you have a public Git repository, skip to Step 3.

1. In the <i>Accessing Git</i> dialog box, copy the SSH key, select your Git provider from the list, and click the associated <i>Go</i> button.
2. Add the copied key to your Git provider.
3. Return to Cloud 66.

<h2 id="3">Step 3: Define your application properties</h2>
Complete the following steps to define the properties Cloud 66 uses to identify your application.

<b>Prerequisites</b><br/>
You must know the URL for your Git repository and the associated Git branch. For instructions on retrieving the Git repo URL and how to format it for this procedure, refer to <a href="http://community.cloud66.com/articles/accessing-your-git-repository#public">Access a public Git repository</a> or <a href="http://community.cloud66.com/articles/accessing-your-git-repository#private">Access a private Git repository</a>.

<ol class="list">
	<li>In the <i>About your app</i> dialog box, do the following actions:
		<ul>
			<li>In the <i>Your Git Repo URL</i> box, enter the URL for your Git repository.</li>
			<li>In the <i>Git branch</i> box, type the branch name. This field defaults to the "master" branch.</li>
			<li>In the <i>Give your stack a name</i> box, type a name for your application stack.</li>
			<li>In the <i>Environment</i> list, select the environment to deploy.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>		
	<li>Click <i>Analyze</i>. Cloud 66 will analyze your application.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="4">Step 4: Review your app configuration</h2>
Cloud 66 analyzes your application and returns the configuration details it detects. Complete the following procedure to verify the application configuration is correct.

1. In the <i>About your app</i> dialog box, verify the returned information. If it is incorrect, make the necessary changes and click <i>Re-analyze my code</i>.
2. In the <i>App configuration</i> dialog box, verify the version information and select the <i>Framework info</i> option you want to use.

<h2 id="5">Step 5: Define deployment properties</h2>
Complete the following steps to define the properties that determine how to deploy your application.

<b>Prerequisites</b><br/>
If deploying to a cloud server, you must know the API key for your cloud provider. If deploying to your server, you must have (or generate) a SSH key for the server. For instructions on generating an SSH key, refer to [Setting up SSH keys](http://community.cloud66.com/articles/setting-up-ssh-keys).

<ol class="list">
	<li>In the <i>Where are you deploying to</i> dialog box, select the deployment target to use.</li>
	<li>Perform one of the following actions, depending on your deployment configuration:
		<ul>
			<li>If deploying to a cloud, select the cloud provider, server region and server size.</li>
			<li>If deploying to a server, enter your username and IP address.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>		
	<li>In the <i>Deployment details</i> dialog box, select the database option to use.</li>
	<li>Click <i>Deploy</i>.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="6">Step 6: Review the deployment logs</h2>
After your application builds successfully, you can view the log generated by the deployment.
