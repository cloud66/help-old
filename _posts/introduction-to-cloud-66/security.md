We take your security extremely seriously at Cloud 66. In order to protect our customers and ensure safe access to their code, infrastructure and servers, we take a wide and deep set of measures to ensure access control, security, damage prevention and error protection.

## Infrastructure security
Our servers are protected with firewalls and intrusion protection systems to protect from malicious traffic. We have lock-out mechanisms in place to prevent automated attacks, as well as monitoring for any malicious activity, and logging.

## Credit Card Information

We do not store any payment information like credit card details on our servers. All credit card information is handled by a third party ([Stripe](http://stripe.com/)).

## Customer protection

All customer sensitive data including API keys, SSH keys and passwords are encrypted with a multi-network setup for the decryption mechanism.

We take a wide range of other measures to improve user's [stack security](/building-your-stack/stack-network-settings), and to help them to improve their security by [upgrading their stacks](/how-to/upgrade-packages.html). Cloud 66 connects to user's servers only from `54.84.166.97` address and all provisioned servers are configured to only allow connections from this IP address.

Additionally, customer source code is only kept for a limited period of time.

## Reporting security issues

We take customer security very seriously. Please <a href="mailto:hello@cloud66.com">contact us</a> if you would like to talk to us about security.
