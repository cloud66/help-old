## About configuring HAProxy
[HAProxy CustomConfig](http://help.cloud66.com/how-to/haproxy-customconfig.html) allows you to configure your load balancer through the comfort of your browser. In addition to the settings described below, you could also refer to the [HAProxy documentation](http://haproxy.1wt.eu/download/1.3/doc/haproxy-en.txt) for more information about configurations.

## View HAProxy stats
Click on the load balancer on your stack page login to your HAProxy stats:
![HAProxy stats](http://cdn.cloud66.com/images/help/haproxy_stats.png)

Once logged in, you will see a variety of statistics for your load balancer, and any potential issues:

## Configure HAProxy to use internal IPs
By default, HAProxy is configured to use the external IP address of your servers, but it can be changed to use the internal addresses if you have private networking enabled.

Simply replace any `server.ext_ipv4` values with `server.int_ipv4` using [HAProxy CustomConfig](http://help.cloud66.com/how-to/haproxy-customconfig.html).

## Specify an HAProxy test interval
You can also specify your own test interval if you like - this is done in the _server_ section of your HAProxy configruation. This section is on line 53 of the default configuration.

To change the test interval to every 30 seconds (instead of the default 2 seconds), the template should look like this:
<pre class="terminal">server          web&#123;&#123; forloop.index &#125;&#125; &#123;&#123; server.ext_ipv4 &#125;&#125;:80 cookie "LSW_WEB&#123;&#123; forloop.index &#125;&#125;" check inter 30000</pre>

Please note the `inter 3000` at the end - this defines the test interval as 3000 milliseconds. Once this template is applied, it looks like this:
<pre class="terminal">server          web1 107.170.99.39:80 cookie "LSW_WEB1" check inter 30000</pre>

## Change the HAProxy endpoint
By default, HAProxy will visit the _/_ endpoint on your application every 2 seconds to determine its state. This endpoint may need to change if that endpoint isn't available to the load balancer.

You will want to look at the _httpchk_ option to change the endpoint - the simplest solution is to create a low overhead non-auth HTTP route somewhere in your application.

For example, you could place a file called _check.html_ in your _/public_ folder, which would be served directly by Nginx (not your application). It would be available at _/check.html_.

In this case, you could replace the _httpchk_ section with this:

`httpchk HEAD /check.html HTTP/1.0`.

## About configuring HAProxy with CustomConfig
You can customize the HAProxy configuration on your HAProxy server using [CustomConfig](/stack-features/custom-config.html). For example, you can follow these instructions to [allow for SSL termination](/how-to/ssl-termination-on-load-balancers.html#haproxy) with your HAProxy setup.

CustomConfig uses the [Liquid templating language](http://liquidmarkup.org/). You can find many incredible guides and tutorials into the Liquid syntax around the web, but the syntax is easy enough to pick up in minutes.

The following variables are available to use in HAProxy CustomConfig.

## Commit HAProxy CustomConfig
Editing and committing HAProxy CustomConfig will do the following steps for your HAProxy web server:

* Check the template for basic Liquid syntax errors
* Compile the HAProxy configuration based on the information from your load balanced web servers
* Upload the configuration to your HAProxy server
* Reload HAProxy

This process will be stopped if an error is encountered.
