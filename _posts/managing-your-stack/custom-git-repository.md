<h2 id="custom">What is Custom Git Repository?</h2>

Every stack has a custom git repository created and managed by cloud66. You can use this repository to manage your CustomConfig files directly with git commands.

You can push your changes in CustomConfig files into this repository which will update CustomConfig of the stack and will be ready to be pushed to real servers with next release. Also if you change CustomConfigs through dashboard, the changes will be pushed to Custom git repository as well, so you can see and manage the changes in your own Git client tool.

<h2 id="access">Access to Custom Git Repository</h2>

To access to the Custom Git Repository you need to upload the content of your public personal key to your cloud66 account through the dashboard. You should find your public personal key `id_rsa.pub` in `~/.ssh` path.  If there is no `id_rsa.pub` in `~/.ssh` path, You should generate a public/private ssh keys first and upload the contents of public one into your cloud66 account.

After you uploaded your public personal key, you can clone the Custom git repository of the stack and start managing your CustomConfigs by pushing your changes in it. You will find the address of Custom Git Repository in Stack Information page.

<div class="notice">
    <h3>Important</h3>
    <p>To be able to use Custom Git Repository, your personal private key should be loaded into ssh-agent of the client computer you are using for configuration. If you are using ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub of the computer as personal public key, it should be loaded by default. You can use `ssh-add` command to list/add keys in `ssh-agent`</p>
</div>

<h2 id="submit_ui">Submit changes through dashboard</h2>

When you push your changes to a CustomConfig through dashboard, Cloud66 will merge and push your changes into Custom Git Repository. If there are no merge conflict, your changes will be applied directly to your servers.
If there are some merge conflict, cloud66 will raise a warning and the changes will cached on local to go to real servers on next deploy so you have this option to solve the conflict before deployment.

<h2 id="submit_git">Submit changes through Git</h2>

When you push your changes for a CustomConfig to Custom Git Repository, Cloud66 will push and merge your changes into stack local caches to go to real servers on next deploy. If there is no merge conflict you should see a warning on your stack showing 'you need to redeploy your stack because of config changes'.  If there are merge conflict, your changes will not be applied in into stack local caches, so your next deployment will go with old configs. You need to solve the merge conflict and push again to Custom Git Repository again in order to update your CustomConfigs.
