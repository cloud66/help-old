## About generating SSH keys
<p>Authentication keys come in two parts:</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		<p>
			<strong>Public Key</strong> &mdash; stored in the <kbd>~/.ssh/authorized&#95;keys</kbd> file of the server that you want to access.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			<strong>Private Key</strong> &mdash; stored on your machine in the <kbd>~/.ssh/</kbd> directory. This allows you to gain access to any machine with the public key.
		</p>
	</li>
</ol>

## Generating and using SSH keys on Linux
<p>Run the <kbd>ssh-keygen</kbd> command in the terminal and answer the questions when prompted, the defaults are acceptable for most use cases.</p>

{% highlight bash %}
ssh-keygen
{% endhighlight %}

<p>The generated keys should now be located in your home directory <kbd>~/.ssh/</kbd></p>

<ul>
	<li>
		You'll find the <strong>private key</strong> in the <kbd>~/.ssh/id&#95;rsa</kbd> file.
	</li>
	<li>
		You'll find the <strong>public key</strong> in the <kbd>~/.ssh/id&#95;rsa.pub</kbd> file.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Copy the public key into the <kbd>~/.ssh/authorized&#95;keys</kbd> file on your server, using the following commands. Substitute your own SSH user and host names:</p>

{% highlight bash %}
scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub squire@example.com:/home/user/.ssh/uploaded_key.pub
ssh squire@example.com "echo `cat ~/.ssh/uploaded+key.pub` >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
{% endhighlight %}

<p>You can now log in to your server using your public key.</p>

<div class="notice">
		<h3>Important</h3>
		<p>Cloud 66 doesn't currently support password protected keys, so please ensure your key is <strong>not</strong> passworded.</p>
</div>

<div class="notice">
    <h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Unfortunately, due to circumstances beyond our control, the third party embedded terminal has been discontinued.</p>
	<p>You need <a href="/your-account/team-accounts.html">administrative privileges for a stack</a> in order to download an SSH key.</p>
</div>

## Cloud 66 toolbelt
You can use the [Cloud 66 toolbelt](/cloud-66-toolbelt/introduction.html) to easily [SSH to your servers](/cloud-66-toolbelt/ssh.html). Once initialized, the following command can be used:
{% highlight bash %}
# Full
cx ssh [-s <stack>] <server name>|<server ip>|<server role>
# Example
cx ssh -s "My Awesome App" Lion
{% endhighlight %}

See [toolbelt shortcuts](/cloud-66-toolbelt/shortcuts.html), for information on how you can make this even easier.

## Direct shell access
You can always have terminal access to your servers from your own server - just follow the steps below if you're on a Linux-based operating system. See our help page on [connecting for Windows-based systems](/how-to/shell-from-windows.html).
<ol>
<li>Port 22 (SSH) is closed to outside traffic by default - so you need to allow your own IP address to access it. See the [stack security](/stack-features/stack-security.html) page to accomplish this.</li>
<li>Once the port is open, you can find your username and SSH key on your server page:</li> ![Direct Shell Access Username](http://cdn.cloud66.com/images/help/ssh_download.png)
<li>Change the access rights to the downloaded key to 0600:</li>
<pre class="terminal">
$ chmod 0600 /Users/xxx/Downloads/key.pem
</pre>

<li>You can now connect to your server with the following command:</li>
<pre class="terminal">
$ ssh user&#95;name@ip&#95;address -i /Users/xxx/Downloads/key.pem
</pre>

## Generating and using SSH keys on Windows
If you're using PuTTY in Windows for SSH services, you can still use SSH keys. PuTTY can generate keys using the puttygen program, <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/" target="&#95;blank">download PuTTY</a>.

We recommend that you use [PuTTy](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/) to SSH to your servers from Windows - go ahead and [download PuTTY and PuTTYgen](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html) and install them.

<ol>
<li>Port 22 (SSH) is closed to outside traffic by default - so you need to allow your own IP address to access it. See the <a href="/stack-features/stack-security.html">stack security</a> page to accomplish this.</li>
<li>Once the port is open, you can find your server IP address, username and SSH key on your server page:</li> <img src="http://cdn.cloud66.com/images/help/ssh_download.png">
<li>PuTTY doesn't natively support the private key format (.pem) provided by Cloud 66, so we'll use PuTTYgen to convert it into the required format (.ppk).</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Open PuTTYgen, and under <i>Type of key to generate</i>, select <i>SSH-2 RSA</i>:</li>
		<img src="http://cdn.cloud66.com/images/help/puttygen_type.png">
		<li>Click <i>Load</i> - by default, PuTTYgen displays only files with the .ppk extension, so we'll need to display all files:</li>
		<img src="http://cdn.cloud66.com/images/help/puttygen_load.png">
		<li>Once you've selected your .pem file, save it as a .ppk file without a passphrase.</li>
	</ul>
<li>Open PuTTy, and input your hostname:</li>
<img src="http://cdn.cloud66.com/images/help/putty_create_session.png">
<li>Next, open the <i>SSH</i> menu item, and click <i>Auth</i>. Hit <i>Browse</i> and select the SSH key created with PuTTYgen.</li>
<img src="http://cdn.cloud66.com/images/help/putty_auth_config.png">
<li>You can now go back to the <i>Session</i> menu, and save this as a session if you wish to connect again in the future.</li>
<li>Click <i>Open</i> to connect to the server.</li>
</ol>

## Generate Keys via Amazon Web Services

<ol class="instruction-list">
	<li><a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/" target="_blank">Open the Amazon EC2 console</a></li>
	<li>
		<p>In the left hand navigation, under Network and Security, click <b>Key Pairs</b>.</p>
		<p><img src="http://cdn.cloud66.com/images/help/aws-key-1.png" alt=""></p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Click <b>Create Key Pair</b>.</p>
		<p><img src="http://cdn.cloud66.com/images/help/aws-key-2.png" alt=""></p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>In the Key Pair dialog, in the Key Pair Name field, type <i>mykeypair</i> for the new key pair and then click Create.</p>
		<p><img src="http://cdn.cloud66.com/images/help/aws-key-3.png" alt=""></p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Download the private key file, which is named <i>mykeypair.pem</i>, and keep it safe.<br>
		You'll need it to access any instances that you launch with this key pair.</p>
	</li>
</ol>
<p>If you need further information please refer to the <a href="http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/gettingstarted/latest/wah-linux/getting-started-create-key-pair.html">Amazon documentation</a>.</p>

## Connect to your server using your key

Simply ensure that your public key contents are included in ~/.ssh/authorized&#95;keys on the target server. Then you should be able to connect with:
{% highlight bash %}
ssh {server user}@{server address}
{% endhighlight %}

If you are using a non-standard key name or location, then you can connect to your server using
{% highlight bash %}
ssh -i {your private key location} {server user}@{server address}
{% endhighlight %}

<div class="notice">
		<h3>Important</h3>
		<p>In both cases above you should not be asked to provide your password.</p>
</div>

Once you are happy that you can connect to your server with your key, best practice would be to disable access to your server via username/password. However this is up to you and your particular requirements.
