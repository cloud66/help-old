To add this add-in, simply click on the _+_ button on the add-ins menu of your stack page, which will show you a variety of add-ins for your stack.

This Docker server task add-in allows you to schedule the execution of tasks (shell commands) on your Docker server host. You can set the timing of the job in either minutes, hours, a daily, weekly and monthly time, as well as on demand (under the hood, scheduled jobs are run as cronjobs on your server).

Your run results (success, failure and any output) can be seen in real-time on the job detail page.
