## Add a Docker service task

This add-in allows you to schedule the execution of tasks (shell commands) on your Docker services. Each time it runs, it starts a new container from the service you select, executes the task and destroys the container. Your run results (success, failure and any output) can be seen in real-time on the job detail page.
