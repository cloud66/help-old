Add-ins allow you to add various internal and external features to your stack. These include [database backups](#), [SSL certificates](#) and server components such as [Redis](#) and [Elasticsearch](#).

To get started, simply click on the _+_ button on the add-ins menu of your stack page, which will show you a variety of add-ins for your stack

A <font color="green">green</font> add-in indicates that there aren't any known issues with that specific add-in, whereas a <font color="red">red</font> add-in indicates an error.
