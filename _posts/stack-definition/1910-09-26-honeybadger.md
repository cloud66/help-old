[Honeybadger](https://www.honeybadger.io/) is a service that provides exception, uptime, and performance monitoring for Ruby.

We'll then connect to your Honeybadger account and install it on your stack:

The beauty of adding this to your stack is that your error counters in Honeybadger are reset every time you deploy your stack, making it easier to keep
track of your errors across deployments.

Honeybadger has a great resource on [how to setup the integration on their side](http://docs.honeybadger.io/article/174-how-to-get-setup-with-cloud-66-and-honeybadger).
