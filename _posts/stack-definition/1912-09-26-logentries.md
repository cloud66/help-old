## About using Logentries
Logentries is a great service for centralizing your log files, and this add-in makes it easy to add across your servers.

## Add Logentries to your stack
To add Logentries, access the add-ins menu of your stack and click _Logentries_.

We'll ask you for your Logentries account key - if you don't have one, you can signup to a Logentries account.

You can find your Logentries account ID in your account page. For more information, please see the [Logentries guide to integrating with Cloud 66](https://logentries.com/doc/cloud66/).
