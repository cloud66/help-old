## Add an SSL certificate
You can easily add a SSL certificate to your stack from the add-in page. Apart from the certificate key and SSL certificate, you can also provide an intermediate certificate and allowed server names (with wildcards accepted).

Once you've provided your SSL certificate and key, we'll install them on all your web servers.

Refer to our [documentation](#) and [troubleshooting](#) pages for more information.
