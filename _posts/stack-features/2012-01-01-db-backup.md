If you have a stack with a database, you can easily back it up by clicking the Protip link:

![Single Click Protip](http://cdn.cloud66.com.s3.amazonaws.com/images/help/database_backup.png)

You can subsequently specify if you would like managed or unmanaged backups, how often you would like to backup your database, and whether or not you would like to Gzip compress your backups.

<div class="notice">
    <h3>Important</h3>
    <p>Compressing your backups will take up less space than not, but will require additional processing during the compression.</p>
    <p>In order for backups to work, you are required to have twice as much space on your server as your backup consumes.</p>
    <p>If enabled, the gzip compression level used by default is 6 (this is not currently editable). See more information about this in the excellent <a href='https://github.com/meskyanichi/backup/wiki/Compressors' target='_blank'>backup gem documentation.</a></p>

Once you have added your backup, it is available on your stack page:

<h2 id="managed">Managed backups</h2>
Having managed backups has several benefits:

- You can download database backups through the web UI and [API](/api/basics/basics.html)
- You can easily restore database backups
- Use [backup verifiers](/stack-features/backup-verifiers.html) to ensure that your backups actually contain the data you expect
- Use [database replication](/stack-features/database-replication.html) to scale your databases
- Stored in Cloud 66 storage

<h2 id="unmanaged">Unmanaged backups</h2>

Unmanaged backups are stored on your local server and are available under `/var/cloud66/backups`.
