There are several logs available for different parts of your server:

- **$STACK_PATH/log**<br/>
This is where you can find your application, worker and other logs relating to your application.

- **/var/log**<br/>
This directory contains logs for authentication requests and fail2ban, among others.

- **/opt/nginx/logs**<br/>
This directory contains logs for nginx access and errors.

## Log rotation
Your logs in $STACK_PATH/log and /var/log are automatically rotated on a daily basis into a sub-directory called archive/ in each respective directory.
These logs are compressed, and can be uncompressed with the following command: `gzip -d <log_file>.log.gz`.
