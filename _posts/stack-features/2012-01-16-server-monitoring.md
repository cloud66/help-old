---

Your servers on Cloud 66 have basic monitoring for their CPU, memory and disk space usage. These vital signs are reported back to Cloud 66 every 20 minutes, and you can see them as a chart on your server page. We collect and keep one week worth of data for each individual server.

## Advanced monitoring
If you would like to have more advanced monitoring on your servers, we suggest using services like [Server Density](http://serverdensity.com/) or [Scout App](https://scoutapp.com/). Alternatively, as you always have full shell root access to your servers, you can deploy and use your favourite monitoring tool like [Nagios](http://www.nagios.org/) as well.
