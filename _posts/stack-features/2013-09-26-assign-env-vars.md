<p class="lead">You can use environment variables in your code and configuration. Cloud 66 ensures that they are available during your deployment and running of the application.</p>

Please be aware of the following while assigning environment variables:

- Environment variables are not escaped - however, they are always wrapped in double quotes (ie. `"ENV_VAR"`) so you can use them with multiline variables like SSH keys.
- A number of environment variables are locked and cannot be modified. For example, environment variables for your server IP addresses cannot be changed because they are automatically set and updated based on your servers reported IP addresses.
- You can reference other environment variables using the `{{ENV_VAR}}` {% endraw %} syntax. This is useful when referencing an environment variable which you don't control, like a server IP address.

## Before initial deploy

Aside from [environment variables that are auto-generated by Cloud 66](/stack-features/auto-generated-env-vars.html), you can set your own before you deploy to your servers:

You can now enter the environment variables you need to deploy or run your app. These will be available to all users on all web servers including all web server processes (<em>nginx</em>) and your rake tasks.

You can also upload environment variables in a file, using the following format:
<pre class="terminal">
KEY&#95;1=value&#95;1
KEY&#95;2=value&#95;2
</pre>

## After initial deploy

After deployment, you can always change, remove or add new environment variables to your stack through the settings drop-down.

<div class="notice">
    <h3>Important</h3>
    <p>You would need to redeploy your stack for environment variable changes to take effect.</p>

See how you can [use environment variables](/stack-features/using-env-vars.html) in your <kbd>database.yml</kbd> or code.
