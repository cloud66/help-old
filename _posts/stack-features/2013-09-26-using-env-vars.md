## Configuration Files
Many developers use environment variables to store database username and passwords and use environment variables in database configuration files instead of hard coding credentials.
This best practice is supported by Cloud 66 and there is no need to change anything to get it to work. You can reference environment variables that are [auto-generated by Cloud 66](/stack-features/auto-generated-env-vars.html), or ones that [you assign](/stack-features/assign-env-vars.html).

This is an example of what your database.yml file might look like with environment variables for the database username and password:
<pre class="terminal">
production:
  adapter: mysql2
  host: db.prod.myapp.com
  database: myapp&#95;prod
  username: &lt;%= ENV['DB&#95;USER'] %&gt;
  password: &lt;%= ENV['DB&#95;PASSWORD'] %&gt;
</pre>
