You can easily rename your stack on the settings page of your stack, but this has an important implication.

<div class="notice notice-standalone">
		<h3>Important</h3>
		<p>The internal c66 domain names are based on the stack name, and will change if you rename your stack.</p>
</div>

As such, you will have to update your DNS to point at the new address to keep your application accessible.
