<p class="lead">Information regarding deploying to your existing servers</p>

You can always use your own servers with Cloud 66 as long as they run meet the ([OS requirements](/help/operating_system)) and are accessible to our servers!

That said, you should [depoy to your cloud provider](/help/cloud_providers) if you would like to take advantage of:

- One-Click Scaling
