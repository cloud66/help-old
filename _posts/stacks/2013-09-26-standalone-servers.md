<p class="lead">Information regarding deploying to your existing servers</p>

You can always use your own servers with Cloud 66 as long as they run meet the [OS requirements](/stacks/operating-system-information.html) and are accessible to our servers!

That said, you should [depoy to your cloud provider](/cloud-providers/supported-cloud-providers.html) if you would like to take advantage of:

* Load Balancing
* One-Click Scaling
