lead: Direct SSH into the servers from commandline
---

## Summary
Allows direct SSH shell into the servers by openning the firewall temporarily for the caller, downloading the SSH key for the server and starting a SSH session with one command.

## Usage
{% highlight bash %}
$ c66 ssh --stack STACK_UID --server_name SERVER_NAME
{% endhighlight %}

## Parameters
* stack - UID of the stack (alias: s)
* server_name - Name of the server to access. This is the user friendly (animal) name of the server. (alias: n)

## Example
{% highlight bash %}
$ c66 ssh --stack ba89f0edfa254d46ba9e15920e7f69be --server_name lion
{% endhighlight %}

## Notes
You can find your stack UID under the Stack Information item of the stack menu in the web dashboard. It is a GUID that looks like this: `ba89f0edfa254d46ba9e15920e7f69be`

`SSH` works by connecting to the Cloud 66 API, downloading the SSH key for the server, storing it under your home page (`~/.ssh`), running the [lease command](/toolbelt/lease.html) to open the SSH port (22) for 20 minutes and starting a SSH session with the server.

You need to have Admin rights over the stack to use this command.
