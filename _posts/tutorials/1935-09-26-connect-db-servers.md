## On the server

You can connect directly into your database server and invoke a database console from there. To do that, please refer to the [terminal connection to servers](http://help.cloud66.com/stack-definition/ssh-to-server.html) documentation.

## With a client

You can also open a firewall port in your database server to allow a remote machine to connect the it. This is possible using the [Stack security](http://help.cloud66.com/stack-definition/network-configuration.html) page, and then you can use a database client from your local computer.
