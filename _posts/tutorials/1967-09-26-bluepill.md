## Commands

When [bluepill](https://github.com/arya/bluepill) is installed on your server, you can control your processes manually from your server command-line interface.

A process Bluepill config is saved into a <code>.pill</code> file. Bluepill loads pill files for each process it manages. See also [Bluepill gem page](http://rubygems.org/gems/bluepill).

When you add processes through Cloud 66 interface, they will be managed by Cloud 66. For instance if you restart your server, they will be automatically restart aswell.

<div class="notice">
    <h3>Process names convention</h3>
	<p>
		Cloud 66 processes beging with "cloud66&#95;" and user processes with "user&#95;"
	</p>
</div>
