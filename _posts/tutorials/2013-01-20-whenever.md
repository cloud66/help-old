<p>If you have the <a href="https://github.com/javan/whenever">whenever gem</a> in your Gemfile (and have a corresponding schedule defined in <i>config/schedule.rb</i>) then Cloud 66 will automatically setup your desired whenever schedules as crontab jobs on the appropriate servers.</p>

<p>Should you wish to remove these jobs, simply remove the schedule file or gem and redeploy. You can target specific servers by using roles in your <i>config/schedule.rb</i> definition.</p>

Instead of using whenever jobs, you may find it more beneficial to use [scheduled rake tasks](/add-ins/rake-task.html). There are a number of benefits with this approach:

<ol class="article-list">
<li>See your jobs (and run history) via the UI, and run them on demand</li>
<li>You can modify their scheduling via the UI</li>
<li>You can get alerts if your job fails</li>
</ol>

Depending on whether you're running your task as a runner, rake or command, you will need to reference environment variables differently. For example, if using a _command_, you'll need to reference your environment in bash syntax, eg. `$STACK_PATH`.

<div class="notice">
 	<h3>Note</h3>
 	<p>Whenever jobs will be run on all your app servers by default - but you can also be more specific about where they should run.
 	</p>
 </div>

<h4>Target all servers</h4>

<pre class="prettyprint">
env :PATH, ENV['PATH']

every 10.minutes do
  command "a&#95;dummy&#95;command"
end
every 45.minutes do
  command "a&#95;dummy&#95;command"
end
</pre>

<h4>Target your web server(s)</h4>

<pre class="prettyprint">
env :PATH, ENV['PATH']

every 10.minutes, :roles => [:app] do
  rake "test:example"
end
</pre>

<h4>Target your database server</h4>

<pre class="prettyprint">
env :PATH, ENV['PATH']

every 10.minutes, :roles => [:db] do
  command "a&#95;dummy&#95;command"
end
</pre>

<h4>Target your Redis server</h4>

<pre class="prettyprint">
env :PATH, ENV['PATH']

every 10.minutes, :roles => [:redis] do
  command "a&#95;dummy&#95;command"
end
</pre>

<h4>Target the first server in a server group</h4>

<pre class="prettyprint">
env :PATH, ENV['PATH']

def primary_runner(command)
  runner("if ENV['PRIMARY'] == 'true'; #{command}; end")
end

every 15.minutes, roles: [:app] do
  primary_runner 'MyClass.some_job' # runs on primary app server only
  runner 'MyClass.another_job' # runs on all app servers
end
</pre>

This will only run _MyClass.some_job_ on your primary app server, and _MyClass.another_job_ on all app servers. It checks whether or not each server
has the _PRIMARY_ environment variable set to true.

<div class="notice">
 	<h3>Note</h3>
 	<p>You should include the line <b>env :PATH, ENV['PATH']</b> at the top of your <i>config/schedule.rb</i> file to avoid command not found errors.
 	</p>
 </div>

<p>You can view your generated crontab jobs with:</p>

<pre class='terminal'>crontab -l</pre>
