<p class="lead">Simple pay as you go pricing. Development environment stacks are free!</p>

## Pay As You Grow
#### Only pay for what you use.
Cloud 66 is a Pay As You Grow service. You only pay for what you use with no setup fees or fixed term contracts. You can leave at anytime you like without any charges.
Its only $9 per server per month for each logical server you use. Paying annually can reduce this to $7 per server too.

## Priced By Server
#### Development Stacks are Free!
Don't pay anything for your development environment stacks.

## Billing Cycle
#### Pay at the end of every 30 days
The billing cycle for your account is every 30 days. Your account charges are calculated hourly. Your account will be charged for the accumulated amount you've accrued during the past 30 days by the end of the cycle.

## How can I use Cloud 66 for my side projects?
#### Get one non-development server for free for your projects
If you would like to use Cloud 66 to deploy and manage your 'side projects' you can do that by simply placing a Cloud 66 badge on your homepage or first page of the site and get 1 production server for free to use on any of your stacks.

Just copy and paste the appropriate code below into your HTML (select HTTP or HTTPS as appropriate) and drop us a line at <a href='mailto:hello@cloud66.com'>hello@cloud66.com</a>.
