## Server Security
Security of your servers and your code has the highest priority for us. We use multiple layers of security on our servers to make sure your code and access to your servers is as secure as it is.

We also actively monitor active security threats from outside our network and react quickly to block those threats. This is however half of the story.

## Cloud 66 Access
Our servers need a two way connection with your servers to deploy and manage your application stacks. We do this via secure remote shelling. We do not allow or provision password protected servers and only use SSH key authentication. This will give you a better level of security however it means your servers will have to allow SSH access on port 22. This is not ideal. To minimize any risks, we publish the IP address of our gateway servers on this page so you can only allow our gateway servers through your firewall.

### Gateway IP Addresses
Cloud 66 only attempts SSH on port 22 to your servers from one of the following IP addresses. Any addition to this list will be announced on this page.
